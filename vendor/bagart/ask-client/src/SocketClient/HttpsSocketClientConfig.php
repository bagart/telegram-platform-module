     *                                          Protocol negotiation is driven by {@see $http2Enabled}, not this flag.

     *                                          {@see $keepAlive} — this is capability negotiation, not lifecycle.

     *                                          When the cap is reached, new requests are queued until a slot opens.

     *                                          address, skipping AAAA/IPv6 fallback that getaddrinfo() would attempt.
     * @param  bool  $dnsCache  Cache resolved host => ip pairs in-process for {@see $dnsCacheTtl} seconds.
     * @param  float  $dnsCacheTtl  Time-to-live for a DNS cache entry, in seconds.
     * @param  int  $maxIdlePerHost  Maximum idle (kept-open) connections kept per host:port key.
     * @param  int  $maxIdleTotal  Global cap on idle connections across all hosts.
     * @param  float  $idleTimeout  Seconds an idle connection may sit in the pool before it is evicted.
     * @param  ?string  $alpnProtos  Explicit ALPN override. When set it wins over {@see $http2Enabled}.

     *                                          (single select per tick); higher processes more ready sockets
     *                                          per kernel tick at the cost of CPU.
     * @param  int  $maxConnectionsTotal  Global cap on concurrent open sockets across all hosts
     *                                          (connecting + active + idle). Guards against hitting FD_SETSIZE
